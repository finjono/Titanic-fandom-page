<br><br>
When the construction of the Titanic began in March 1909, the building was considered to be second to none, a marvel of modern engeneering. The ship was supposed to be the largest, fastest, safest, most comfortable and most expensive ever to be created.
<br><br>
RMS Titanic was operated by the White Star Line and build by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Its chief naval architect was Thomas Andrews.
<br><br>
It took over one year to fully frame the Titanic. Large steel plates, one inch thick, were rivented to the frame. Over three million rivets hold the steel in place.
<br><br>
To build it safe, the ship was equipped with the latest technology: it had 15 watertight bulkheads that devided the ship into sixteen compartments, which had doors that could close automatically if the water level rose above a certain height. In addition to that they were able to be electronically closed from the bridge. The ship was designed in such a way that it could remain afloat if any two of the middle compartments or the first four compartments were flooded.
<br><br>
With its three propellers powered by two steam engines and a low-pressure turbine, a top speed of 23 knots was made possible. In the hull, the Titanic had 29 boilers containing 159 coal burning furnaces. To expel the gas, the Titanic was fitted with three funnels which were constructed off site. A fourth funnel was added to make the ship look more powerful. Cosmetic appeal was largely valued during this time: although 64 lifeboats would have been needed to safe peoples` lives in case of any danger, it was only equipped with twenty in order to make the ship look better.
<br><br>
Regarding the size of the Titanic, the ship exceeded all superlatives to be known up to the year of its buliding: it was 882,9 feet long, 92 feet wide, 59 feet high from water level and weightened over 46000 tons. It had the capacity to carry 3547 passangers. The total costs amounted to 7,5 million Dollars and it took 15000 shipbuilders and 26 months to build it.
<br><br>
The ship was fitted with everything someone luxurious would want from a cruise liner: First class on board included veranda cafes, a smoking room, a dining saloon and a reading and writing room. There were such things as a heated pool, a gymnasium, a squash court, libraries and a Turkish bath. Second-class passengers also had an entire room, that could be compared to a large hotel room. To complete the interior features, it took about ten months.
