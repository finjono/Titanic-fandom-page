    <p class="articletext" data-aos="zoom-in-down" data-aos-delay="1400" data-aos-duration="1000">Titanic was produced, directed and written by James Cameron in year 1997, and is about a rich 
woman named Rose Dewitt Bukater who falls in love with a young third-class passenger on the 
Titanic named Jack Dawson. Together they spent a few romantic days on the ship before it hits an 
iceberg. While the first part of the movie is rather dedicated to the relationship of the two 
characters, the second part deals with the sinking of Titanic. 
<br><br>
The main characters of the movie Titanic are embodied of Leonardo Di Caprio (Jack Dawson), Kate 
Winslet (Rose Dewitt Bukater) and Billy Zane (Caledon Hockley). 
<br><br>
James Cameron’s idea and inspiration of making such a disaster film was caused by his fascination of 
shipwrecks as he says “Titanic is the Mount Everest of shipwrecks.“ When he shared his script with 
20th century fox, they were first a bit dubious about a three-hour romantic epic, but hoped for a 
long-term relationship with Cameron, so they gave him permission. 
<br><br>
In a period of two years, he organized several dives to picture the wreck while he and the crew was 
surrounded by a water pressure of 6,000 thousand pounds. The use of making such a dangerous 
expedition was for the whole opening scene where they’re exploring the Titanic and finding the safe. 
There wasn’t always a good course while making the shots, one of the submersible’s hit the Titanic’s 
hull once so that the quarters of Captain Smith collapsed, exposing the interior.
<br><br>
 Working on a Titanic film was not just a job for Cameron, he put his whole energy into the project, 
he felt “great responsibility, “because “There probably aren’t going to be many filmmakers who 
actually go to the wreck (...) you get such a strong sense of the profound sadness and injustice of 
it, and the message of it. “ 
<br><br>
It was especially important for him to honor the people who died, so he spent six months of 
researching them before writing the script. Furthermore, Cameron created a detailed timeline of 
what exactly happened in the few days before the sinking and got some historical experts who 
analyzed as well as commented the script, so he could adjust it.
<br><br>
For producing the film, Cameron first needed to rebuild the Titanic in a detailed way, so he hired 
two historians to authenticate it. The sets of the interior rooms were reproduced in the same way 
as it was originally built.
<br><br>
James Cameron’s second name in the film-business was ‘the scariest man in Hollywood' so he did 
honor to his name and screamed at everyone who he could scream at on the sets. He became 
known as a perfectionist and “300-decibel screamer”, and even Kate Winslet confessed later that 
she was frightened of him sometimes. The Titanic crew felt like Cameron had an evil alter ego so 
they gave him another name. To the criticism he later said “Film-making is war.”
<br><br>
During the production in Canada one of the crew members put a drug into the soup Cameron and
others ate one night which resulted in sending 50 people to the hospital. The person behind the 
poisoning was never caught. The schedule of the production grew up to 160 days because of 
incidents like that and a few cast members, including Kate Winslet, who infected themselves by 
spending hours in cold water. In an Interview she decided she’d never work with Cameron again 
unless she gains a lot of money.</p>
