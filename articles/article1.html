The sinking of the Titanic is without a doubt the biggest disaster, that ever happened to a ship and there are several reasons, why the crash was as devastating as it was.
<br>
For example the journalist Senan Molony claims that the main reason for the Titanic to sink was a smoldering fire in the ship's coal bunker boiler rooms, which took place in Southampton before the ship even left the port. This fire weakened the ship's structure, so that the iceberg crash was more devistating, than it otherwise would have been.
<br>
Furthermore it seems like there was another problem, which was caused by the fire. Many Experts suspect, that the fire was the main reason, the Titanic travelled at full speed, although it was designed for comfort. 
<br><br>
<i>What has a fire to do with the speed of a ship?</i>
<br><br>
Well, the standard technique for controlling and eliminating such fires on steamships, was to remove more and more of the coal from the bunker and instead pur it into the steam engine boiler. This was done in order to increase the rate of draw-down of the coal pile. So as a result, because there was way more steam than usual they also had to increase the steaming rate, which is the reason for the quicker cruising. 
<br><br>
<i>So a ship that was considered unsinkable, sank just beacause of a small fire?</i>
<br><br>
The Titanic already had a few… let's say safety issues, before the fire even took place. To give you a few examples:
The ship, although it was considered unsinkable was not made from the best materials. The pieces holding together the steel plates toward the bow and the stern were not made of solid metal. They were made of low-quality iron rivets that could have broken more easily in a collision. 
It nearly looks like nobody even thought of the slight possibility, that the ship could crash into something. There weren't even enough lifeboats for all the people on-board. Instead of the 40 you would have needed to transport all passengers, there were only 20. In the end these 20 lifeboats weren't even filled up completely. They could hold 1718, but only about 700 passengers survived.
<br><br>
<i>Why couldn't they fill them up completely?</i>
<br><br>
The reason for this is, that the first few lifeboats were sent out half-empty. On top of that the order of the captain of the ship, Edward John Smith, to first let the women and children get into the boats caused much irritation. Nevertheless the main reason probably was the panic of all people, who were still on the Titanic. 
However next to the lifeboat shortage, there was also a possible shortage of binoculars, which could have spotted the Iceberg.This was due to the fact, that the officer, who had the key to the supply was bumped from the crew last-minute.
<br><br>
<i>So the main mistakes were made before the ship even started?</i>
<br><br>
Yes and no. Yes there were many misjudgements and problems before the start, but the crew itself also unwillingly helped to make the crash possible. It was a chain of mistakes, which started before the crash happened.
Firstly the senior radio operator Jack Phillips did not pass along the last and clearest warning about an iceberg to the capitan, since he deemed it non-urgent. Nevertheless the fault is not on him to 100%, because the message did not have the prefix "MSG" (Masters' Service Gram), which would have required the captain to personally acknowledge, that he has received the message.
Secondly according to Louise Patten, who is the granddaughter of Charles Lightoller, the ship's most senior surviving officer, her grandfather told her, that a crew member turned the ship right into the course of the iceberg.
<br><br>
<i>How could this happen?</i>
<br><br>
Well the First Officer William Murdoch spotted the iceberg first and gave a 'hard a-starboard' order. The problem was, that the Titanic was operating under two communication systems. So under the one system a command to turn 'hard a-starboard' meant to turn the wheel right and under the other it meant to turn it left. Unfortunatly they could not correct the move in-time.
<br><br>
As you can see there were many problems caused by humans, regarding the Titanic. However the climate also played a very important role. The reason for this is, a rare lunar event,which could have put the iceberg in the ship's path. 
That means, that the earth maybe was closer to the sun and moon as usual in this year, which could have caused record tides, that may have pushed icebergs from the coasts of Labrador and Newfoundland into the North Atlantic.
<br><br>
The disaster of the Titanic is very sad, but also in certain points rather ironic. It just shows, how the natural drive of the humanity to have everything done faster and make it bigger, can also make a 180 degree turn and hit us very brutal.</p>
