    <p class="articletext" data-aos="zoom-in-down" data-aos-delay="1400" data-aos-duration="1000"><b>The Titanic boarded 1300 passengers and there were 918 crew and staff members which makes the number of people on Titanic 2226. 1523 people died which means that only 32% survived. However, behind those numbers are so many touching stories and here you can find a few of them.</b>
<br><br>
<br>
One passenger was the 23-year-old Elsie Bowerman. After she survived the tragic night she fought for women rights and served her country in the wars as a nurse. Later, when it was allowed, she became a lawyer.She sat in lifeboat six together with Margaret “Molly” Brown who you might already know from the blockbuster. Her husband became rich through the mining business and she was known for her flashy hats and charming personality. After the sinking everyone would know her as “The unsinkable Molly Brown”. People would tell about her bravery she showed in the lifeboat as she helped victims in the water in and helped steer the lifeboat. Moreover, she argued for returning to the ship to help more survivors.
<br><br>
The youngest survivor of the tradgedy was Millvina Dean. She boarded at two months old and she died, not long ago, in 2009, what also makes her the longest-living survivor. She got into a lifeboat with her mother and brother and later became a media fixture.
<br><br>
<br>
However, the night of 14 April 1912 did not bring us tragic but also heroric stories. The heroes of the survivors was the Carpathia and her crew. They were awarded and named the official rescue ship of Titanic. 
<br><br>
The heroes of the sinking night are the musicians. The eight men led by violinist Wallace Hartley chose to stay on board, despite the chance of getting in a lifeboat. They played their music till the end, calming the passengers and trying to avoid a panic. They are perhaps the most honored victims of the tragedy.
<br><br>
Another heroric victim is the priest who stayed on the sinking ship to pray with the people and listen to confession, helping them face their fate.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>Did you know that there were twelve dogs on board?</b>
<br><br>
<br>
They were pets of the passengers and they were kept in kennels. There was even a dog show planned on the 15 April. Sadly only three of the dogs survived.
<br><br>
The Titanic had her own official cat named Jenny and there were also a few birds on board. They all sunk with the ship. Some passengers had to leave their pets behind while others refused to. The three dog which survived were brought into the lifeboats. A few days after the sinking, as they searched the corpses they found a passenger, dead, but still holding her dog in her arms.
<br><br>
<br>
You can´t tell all the tales of Titanic, but if anything we can learn from the people you lived through the tragedy, like Eva Hart who once said:”People I meet always seem surprised that I do not hesitate to travel by train, car, airplane or ship when necessary. It is almost as if they expect me to be permanently quivering in my shoes at the thought of a journey. If I acted like that I would have died of fright many years ago – <b>life has to be lived irrespective of the possible dangers and tragedies lurking round the corner.”</b>
